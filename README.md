# A-Day-at-the-Races
This program was a lab that was presented in Headfirst c#. The lab provides the blueprint on what the program should do and the steps to accomplish the task. The program " A Day at the Races" is my solution to the lab.

The application will take bets from 3 different guys on the next dog race. After all bets are collected, the user will start the race to finalize bets. Once the race is completed, the winnings will be distributed. The guys can keep playing as long as they have the funds to do so.
